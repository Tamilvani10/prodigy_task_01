**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

**OVERVIEW:**
Welcome to the House Price Prediction repository, where we use machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. This project focuses on leveraging linear regression to accurately estimate housing costs using a dataset sourced from the Kaggle Housing Prices Competition.

**DATASET:**
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Housing Prices Competition. It contains detailed information about various houses, including square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and corresponding sale prices.

**TECHNIQUES:**
We employ linear regression as the primary technique to establish a relationship between house prices and key features like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. This approach enables us to create a reliable model for predicting house prices based on these critical variables.

**PURPOSE:**
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the application of linear regression in predicting real estate prices, providing insights into how machine learning can enhance accuracy in housing market predictions.
