This respository implements a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## Description
Managing the acutal problems which occurs, and coating the most relaibe cost is the major issue. By using machine learning this proble can be handled in a more easier and relaible manner with the regression techniques coded on thenm.
The objective of this linear regression is to analyze the given dataset and creat the most prcise model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Housing Prices Competition dataset from Kaggle.

## Techniques
The technique used here is linear regression which is used to estimate a linear relationship between prices of house based on their square footage and number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
